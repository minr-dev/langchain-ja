# Conversation Buffer | 会話バッファ

このノートブックは、`ConversationBufferMemory`の使用方法を示しています。このメモリを使うことでメッセージを保存し、後で変数にメッセージを取り出すことができます。

> This notebook shows how to use `ConversationBufferMemory`. This memory allows for storing messages and then extracts the messages in a variable.

まず、文字列として抽出することができます。

> We can first extract it as a string.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

また、メッセージの履歴をリストとして取得することもできます（これはチャットモデルと一緒に使用する場合に便利です）。

> We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Using in a chain | チェーンで使用する際に

最後に、チェーン内でこれを使用する方法を見てみましょう（プロンプトが見えるように`verbose=True`を設定します）。

> Finally, let's take a look at using this in a chain (setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt).

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```

    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

    Current conversation:

    Human: Hi there!
    AI:

    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

```python
conversation.predict(input="I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
